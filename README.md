# MOOC COURSES

A list of all the online courses I have taken which matches a master degree in data science. Currently, I am still pursuing the degree, there are still a lot of courses left I should keep study. I mainly took courses offered by Coursera,Edx and Udacity. I took the liberty to add electives that I saw interesting.
