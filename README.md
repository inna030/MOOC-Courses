# MOOC COURSES

A list of all the online courses I have taken or in progress which matches a master degree in data science. 
I mainly took courses offered by Coursera, Edx and Udacity. I took the liberty to add electives that I saw interesting. 


# Curriculum

The MSDS curriculum is inspired by master programs of top-tier Universities in the USA.  

The template curriculum can be found here: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/machineLearning/
